Stock Market Project ðŸ“ˆ
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates a time series analysis of stock market data. The project explores various techniques for processing, visualizing, and analyzing stock data, focusing on understanding trends, patterns, and predictions using Python libraries.

Introduction: The Stock Market Project is a time series analysis task applied to stock market data. It utilizes Python's statistical and visualization libraries to process raw data and derive meaningful insights, such as stationarity testing, seasonality trends, and predictive modeling.

Key Goals: Explore historical stock market data, Test stationarity using methods like the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test, Visualize distributions, trends, and seasonality in stock prices and
Build and evaluate forecasting models.

Features: Data Preprocessing, Handle missing values, Convert datetime columns for easy manipulation and Set Datetime as the index for time series operations.

Visualization: Histogram and boxplots for target variable distribution, Line plots for stock trends and Heatmaps for correlation analysis.

Statistical Analysis:Stationarity tests (ADF Test) and Seasonality decomposition (additive and multiplicative models).

Modeling: Develop machine learning models for forecasting stock prices.
